I'm Asa Nyaga - an AI engineer and product manager based in Nairobi, Kenya.

I help businesses understand and integrate AI into their products and operations. Not the hype-cycle version ; the practical kind, where you figure out what's actually worth building, what the real risks are, and how to get from pilot to production.

## What I do

- **AI Strategy & Integration** : Helping technical and business leaders evaluate where AI fits in their stack, what to build vs. buy, and how to avoid expensive dead ends.
- **Hands-on Engineering** : Building AI agents, LLM-powered features, and the infrastructure around them. I write about what I build in the [tutorials](/tutorials/) section of this site.
- **Product Thinking** : Bridging the gap between what's technically possible with AI and what actually solves a user problem.

## This blog

I write here to think clearly and to share what I learn. You'll find three kinds of posts:

- **[Tutorials](/tutorials/)** : Step-by-step technical guides. Currently a series on building AI agents from scratch.
- **[AI Strategy](/ai-strategy/)** : Guides for decision-makers navigating AI adoption. Separating hype from practical concerns.
- **[Perspectives](/perspectives/)** : Opinion pieces on AI and the future of work.

## Get in touch

If you're exploring how AI could work for your business, I'd be happy to talk.
